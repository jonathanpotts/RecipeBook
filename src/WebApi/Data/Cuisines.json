In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalape\u00F1o, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth, then transfer to a serving bowl and set aside.\n3. After the peppers have sweated, remove them from the bag and peel off the charred skin. Make a vertical slit down the side of each pepper and carefully remove the seeds, leaving the stem intact.\n4. Stuff each pepper with the cheese strips, ensuring they are filled but can still be closed with a toothpick.\n5. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg yolks with a pinch of salt. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the yolks.\n6. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Roll each stuffed pepper in flour, shaking off the excess, then dip into the egg batter, coating it evenly.\n7. Fry the coated peppers in the hot oil, turning occasionally, until they are golden brown on all sides. This should take about 4-5 minutes.\n8. Once fried, transfer the Chiles Rellenos to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.\n9.
